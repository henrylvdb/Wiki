The charging bench is a machine that is used to charge items with a stored power source. It is in the [electric machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Wiki/blob/master/pages/Electric-Machines.md)
category. It is crafted with an [enhanced crafting table.](https://github.com/Slimefun/Wiki/blob/90e1d7bffd0a40a67667cf9799ee74dbe6651928/pages/Enhanced-Crafting-Table.md)

## Usage

To use a charging bench, right click on the charging bench and place the item you want to charge in the first slot. After some time, the fully charged item will appear in the second slot.

## Setup

A charging bench must be powered with an [energy regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Wiki/blob/90e1d7bffd0a40a67667cf9799ee74dbe6651928/pages/Energy-Regulator.md) or a energy connector.
